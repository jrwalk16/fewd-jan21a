This is my final project for Code Louisville. It uses CSS features to switch the style of the navigation menu as well as Flexbox to rearrange content for mobile or desktop views. I created a JavaScript function that calculates an example score from an Australian Rules Football game. A user will input a number into each box then click the score button. The user will see the generated score below the button.
